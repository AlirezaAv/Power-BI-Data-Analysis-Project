# üìä Global Socioeconomic Analysis ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard Project

This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analytical framework for exploring global socioeconomic and financial indicators across countries and regions. Through interactive dashboards, visualizations, and data modeling, this project reveals key insights for policymakers, researchers, and organizations to better understand development trends, economic disparities, and the impacts of financial indicators.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- **Analyze Social & Economic Conditions:** Explore indicators like marriage rate, divorce rate, inflation, poverty, GDP, gold prices, and population.
- **Decision-Making Support:** Provide dashboards and data-driven insights for governments, NGOs, and analysts.
- **Future Forecasting:** Use predictive modeling (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to estimate future trends in key indicators.
- **Global Comparison:** Compare developing vs. developed countries using clustering and regional analysis.
- **Advanced Insights:** Analyze influence of financial indicators (like gold or currency rates) on social conditions.
